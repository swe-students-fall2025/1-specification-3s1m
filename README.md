## Stakeholders

Stakeholder
- Name: Sultan
- Role/ who they are: senior CS student at NYIT. Currently in a lot of study groups and group projects, working on his senior project this semester with 6 other classmates.
- Date interviewed: 9/16

Goals / needs:
- easily propose a group meet up session fast with 2-5 time options
- share a simple code or link that anyone can join (no account)
- See everyone's selections on one screen
- get a clear "winning time" to lock and share
- Mobile flow that is quick for first time users

Problems / frustrations:
- chat messages like discord get buried and confusing to keep up with
- Late replies and unclear emoji reactions
- Hard to compare availability without manual tallying
- Picking a time that later misses someone's availability
- Time-zone difference adds confusion

## Product Vision Statement

GroupMeets is a simple mobile app where an organizer proposes 2–5 time slots, and share a link or code then friends vote on what works, and the organizer confirms the best study-session time quickly.

## User Requirements

As an organizer, I want to add 2–5 time options so I can offer choices.

As an organizer, I want to remove a time option before creating so I can fix mistakes.

As an organizer, I want the Create button disabled until there are at least two time options so I don’t create an empty session.

As an organizer, I want an inline message if anything is missing so I know what to fix.

As a participant, I want to open a link so I can join without any setup.

As a participant, I want to enter a code to join so I can vote even if I don’t have the link.

As any user, I want a clear error if a code is invalid so I know to check with the organizer.

As any user, I want buttons large enough to tap on mobile so I can use it comfortably.

As an organizer, I want voters to state why they didn’t choose certain slots, so I can refine future time options.

As an organizer, I want multi-select voting and a per-option roster of who chose it, so I can coordinate follow-ups.

As an organizer, I want results to auto-generate charts, so I can spot the best time quickly.

As an organizer, I want notifications for new options and deadline reminders, so participants respond on time.

As an organizer, I want to export voting data, so I can share and analyze results outside the system.

As an organizer, I want to restrict voting to invited emails or a domain, so I can prevent unauthorized responses.

As an organizer, I want to duplicate an existing poll, so I can reuse a prior setup quickly.
As any user, I want to edit my vote until a deadline, so I can adapt to schedule changes.

As a participant, I want to see existing votes before casting mine, so I can align with the team’s preferences.

As a participant, I want times to auto-detect and convert to my time zone with a manual override, so I can confirm availability accurately when traveling.

As a participant, I want to propose a new time, so overlooked slots can be considered.

As a participant, I want to attach a short note to my vote, so my constraints are clear.

As any user, I want confirmed results to auto-add to my calendar with notes and provide an ICS download, so I can avoid manual entry.
