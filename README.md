## Stakeholders

Stakeholder
- Name: Sultan
- Role/ who they are: senior CS student at NYIT. Currently in a lot of study groups and group projects, working on his senior project this semester with 6 other classmates.
- Date interviewed: 9/16

Goals / needs:
- easily propose a group meet up session fast with 2-5 time options
- share a simple code or link that anyone can join (no account)
- See everyone's selections on one screen
- get a clear "winning time" to lock and share
- Mobile flow that is quick for first time users

Problems / frustrations:
- chat messages like discord get buried and confusing to keep up with
- Late replies and unclear emoji reactions
- Hard to compare availability without manual tallying
- Picking a time that later misses someone's availability
- Time-zone difference adds confusion

## Product Vision Statement

GroupMeets is a simple mobile app where an organizer proposes 2–5 time slots, and share a link or code then friends vote on what works, and the organizer confirms the best study-session time quickly.

## User Requirements

As a user, I want to rate my availability across proposed times, so that the organizer can pick the most suitable option.

As a high school student, I want to be able to do group chat with my friends and whenever I say a time in the group chat it allows me to schedule something at that time so that we can schedule time more easily.

As an art student, I want to be able to leave comments for different time slots so that the organizer can better choose the best time.

As a doctor, I want the app to send me reminder about the meeting time so that I wouldn’t forget about the chosen time.

As a college student of economics, I want the app to link to calendar so that I can arrange other stuff accordingly.

As a remote worker, I want the app to automatically adjust proposed time slots to my local time zone so that I don’t get confused about meeting times.

As a project manager, I want to see a summary of everyone’s availability across time slots so that I can quickly confirm the best option without checking each response one by one.
